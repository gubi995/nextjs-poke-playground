# nextjs-poke-playground

The purpose of this project is to experience NEXT.JS features and capabilities.

Following technologies used in the project:

- Next.js
- TS
- Styled Components
- Public pokemon API "https://pokeapi.co/"

Because it is just about experiencing I do not really strive to clean code but I think it is okay.
